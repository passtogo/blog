          Documented or Undocumented Citizens: Every Person Has Basic Human
          Rights
        </h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on November 12, 2023</p>

        <p>
          Documented or Undocumented, Legal or illegal, Citizen or non-citizen,
          words used to clasify what rights we have! We're diving into a topic
          that's often surrounded by serious faces and stern discussions: the
          rights of documented and undocumented citizens. But fear not, because
          we're about to sprinkle a little lightness onto this heavy
          conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          First things first, let's get this out of the way: we all have rights.
          Yes, you, me, your neighbor, and even that person you see at the
          grocery store every Sunday. It doesn't matter if you're carrying a
          passport the size of a novel or if you've got a collection of stamps
          from around the world — human rights are like the VIP pass to the
          global party, and everyone's invited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, the whole "documented" and "undocumented" talk can get a bit
          confusing, like trying to assemble furniture with instructions that
          only make sense in another dimension. But fear not! The key is
          recognizing that, at the end of the day, we're all human beings with a
          bunch of rights in our back pockets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Picture this: you've got a universal remote control, and guess what?
          It's loaded with human rights channels. These channels are the same
          for everyone, whether you're binge-watching documentaries on Netflix
          or sitting in a cozy café in Paris.
        </p>

        <p>
          One essential channel on this universal remote is the "Dignity and
          Respect" channel. It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned explorer with
          stamps from every continent or if your passport has seen better days —
          you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It's like the
          unwritten rule of the global etiquette handbook.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up, we've got the "Fair Play" channel. This one is all about
          justice and due process. Imagine it as the referee in the game of
          life, ensuring that everyone gets a fair shot. So, whether you're
          wearing a suit, a sombrero, or a kimono, you're entitled to a fair and
          impartial hearing. Game on!
        </p>

        <p>
          Education is like the "Learning & Growing" channel. Every kiddo, no
          matter where they're from or where they're headed, has the right to
          access education. It's like the superpower that transforms societies
          and makes the world a cooler place. So, let's make sure everyone gets
          a seat in this classroom of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room – immigration policies.
          We get it; it's a touchy subject. But imagine if we could approach it
          like planning a massive potluck. Everyone brings something unique to
          the table, and with a bit of communication and understanding, we can
          create a feast that satisfies everyone's cravings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communities, that's where you come in! Be the hosts of the global
          block party. Start conversations, share stories, and dispel myths.
          It's like spicing up the potluck with flavors from every corner of the
          world. Let's build communities that throw the best parties, where
          everyone feels welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the grand symphony of life, let's remember that our shared humanity
          is the melody that ties us all together. Documented or undocumented,
          with passports stamped or pristine, we're all part of the same global
          playlist.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, the next time you find yourself in a serious conversation about
          the rights of documented and undocumented citizens, throw in a
          sprinkle of lightness. Because at the end of the day, we're all
          navigating this wild ride called life, and a little laughter can make
          the journey a whole lot brighter. Cheers to human rights, diversity,
          and the incredible adventure of being alive!
        </p>

        <h3>Final words</h3>
        <p>
          For a country born under the idea of unity, justice, tranquility,
          defense, welfare and liberty to secure its prosperity, sorting people
          to give some those opening lines and ignore the rest is history
          repeating itself. It seems we lack the knowledge or skill to learn
          from past mistakes. What is it that makes a country born out of those
          moral ideals not strive to reach its goal laid out on its birth
          certificate? Why build a wall in our own community? The fact is we
          won’t reach anywhere where the founding fathers of this country set
          out to steer it.
